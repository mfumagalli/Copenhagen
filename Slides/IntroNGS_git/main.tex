%%%%%% UNOFFICIAL ICL BEAMER TEMPLATE V.0.1 %%%%%%
% This is a basic LaTeX Beamer template that I customised to have the logo of ICL and a background picture. Mind that this is NOT an official ICL template but it may still be useful for informal presentations.
% The official ICL graphical identity resources can be found here: http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/graphicidentity
% Please drop me an e-mail or comment via Twitter @AJunyentFerre if you found this was useful or have any suggestion to improve it.
